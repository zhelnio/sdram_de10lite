# sdram_de10lite
Terasic sdram rtl demo have some errors.

I've tried to run this demo to make the AHB-Lite SDRAM controller for MipsFPGA+ system.
But it is not working ([details](https://github.com/zhelnio/sdram_de10lite/commit/5c42eefde14cb6a235d0f82fa5d69878aeffc7a9)).
So I have to write [my own SDRAM controller](https://github.com/zhelnio/ahb_lite_sdram) ~~with blackjack and hookers(c)~~.
